    "## **1 Introduction**\n",
    "In rapid gowing tourism industry in Indonesia, a recommendation system becomes a key instrument in travel platforms. A recommendation system does not only offers personalization to customers based on their individual preferences or past behaviors but also streamlines travel planning process. With the system, customers save more time and effort as the system displays contents relevant travel destination to them according to their platform data (e.g., previous search or booking). In the business perspective, a recommendation system helps company generate more bookings and purchases by promoting relevant contents to customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a highly competitive market, travel businesses face challenges in maximizing operational efficiency and revenue. In Indonesia, there have been many giant travel companies such as Agoda, Traveloka, and Booking\\.com. Countless travel options are available, complicating the process of targeting relevant contents to the customers, and thus, leading to potential missed revenue opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this challenge, I will build a recommendation system to increase the conversion rates by showing relevant travel destination to the customers. While recommendation system which will be built here is a hybrid one, I will show how content-based and collaborative filtering systems work. Hybrid recommendation system uses both content-based and collaborative filtering to deal with weaknesses of each recommendation system. \n",
    "- Content-based filtering sometimes can be too similar to the user's past activities, leading to more limited exposure to new and different items. Hybrid approach combines two recommendation systems to find balance between relevance and recency.\n",
    "- Collaborative filtering system may favor popular items. As a result, the recommendations can lack diversity and potentially neglect less popular items. Hybrid approach reduces this bias to the popular items.\n",
    "It is important to highlight here that the hybrid recommendation system here is not a machine learning solution, but a distance-based approach for an initial development. This distance-based hybrid recommendation system is more straightforward because it only uses similarity measures, making it easier to implement. \n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets listed below were taken from [Prabowo](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aprabowo/indonesia-tourism-destination?select=tourism_with_id.csv) on Kaggle. In addition to these four datasets, I will also use Indonesian stop word list collected from [Hartono](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oswinrh/indonesian-stoplist) on the same platform. This list is crucial since making content-based filtering requires text preprocessing, particularly for removing non-content words which are not relevant for the goal.\n",
    "- `package_tourism`: file containing places, time, cost, and rating\n",
    "- `tourism_rating`: consists of three columns, namely user, place, and rating\n",
    "- `tourism_with_id`: tourist attractions in 5 cities in Indonesia\n",
    "- `user`: user data"

Afterwards, text cleaning will be performed to avoid noise in the text preprocessing technique, especially for content-based filtering. "

Based on the data types only, there is only one numerical feature, i.e., Coordinate, mistakenly identifed as object. It is quite understandable since the column contains strings such as `lat` and `lng` (latitude and longitude, respectively). Even if coordinates are crucial, this column will still not be used because it has been represented by two separate columns, namely `Lat` and `Long`. And for this project, I will not use coordinates so the misidentification can be left untreated.\n",

The missing value treatment in the context of this project is not necessary since this column is not relevant for the goal of this project. \n",
    "- In terms of duplicates, the duplicate rate is only 1% of the total data but it remains unknown how many duplicates are in the dataset since the initial screening only provides the percentage of duplicates, not the raw count. \n",
