# A Hybrid Recommendation System for Indonesian Travel Destination

## About
This project seeks to build a hybrid recommendation system to display more personalized travel destinations to platform users based on user preferences and the place descriptions. The creation of this hybrid system involves building separate individual systems, namely item-based and user-based filtering, to evaluate the limitations of each recommender. The hybrid system, combination between item-based and user-based filtering, addresses the limitations of each recommender by demonstrating the advantages of the hybrid recommender. Furthermore, a cosine similarity was chosen over machine learning since it is more suitable for straightforward recommendations and quicker in the implementation. With this simple recommender, the business can implement the recommendation system quicker, shortening the development process.
